# SpotifyApp
(In progress)\
This is a song recommendation app deployed using Flask. You can try out the app at this link: --- \
The model checks the inputted playlist against a predetermined dataset of songs and outputs the songs that are most similar based on a multitude of criteria.
To see how the feature engineered dataset was created, as well as a more in-depth explanation of how the model works, go to /notebooks. 

The idea for this project was inspired by [Eric Chang on Medium](https://medium.com/@enjui.chang). \
The raw data was taken from a small subset of [AIcrowd's Spotify Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge).
